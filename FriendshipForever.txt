This is going to be a double hunt...

My childhood friend James has posted something about the project he made on his socials (just to flaunt).

Today is our submission day and my friend James is absent. 

Yesterday when we met him, he told me, "Mark can you submit my project also with yours, as I will be going out of the city tomorrow morning."

He forgot to tell me anything about his project.

He is not even picking up my phone. 
Help me to find him.
